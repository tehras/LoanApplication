/**
 * {@link rx.Observable.Transformer} that couples data and view status
 *
 * If view is attached (latest emitted value from view observable is true) then values from data
 * observable propagates us usual.
 *
 * If view is detached (latest emitted value from view observable is false) then values from data
 * observable propagates using following rules:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>If data observable emits onError then it would be delivered after view is attached</li>
 *     <li>If data observable emits onCompleted then after view is attached last onNext value from
 *     data observable is delivered followed by onCompleted event</li>
 *     <li>If data observable emits multiple values then after view is attached last emitted value
 *     is delivered</li>
 * </ul>
